# Data-Analytics-project-
This is a brief analysis and insights that i got from the superstore data set related to sales ,from kaggel. I have worked on this project using python.
In this project I have performed pre processing of imputing the missing values of data, data cleaning, statistical analysis, descriptive analysis through visualization and exploratory analysis through tabling methods. To performed the analysis i used pandas, seaborn, Numpy and plotting libraries. I have represented the data using pivot tables.

Key take aways from the project

 I have distributed the data based on different cities, branches, and payment methods using pie charts and i found that there is no much difference between them.
The gross income from the female customers is more compare to males customers.
 The highest quantity of products sold are Home and lifestyle also Electronic accessories. The least are Electronic accessories.
 Food and beverages products have the highest sales.
